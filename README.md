# Instructions  

## Day 1 

1. In the file named `index.html` change the `title` to be your first name's site
    ex: `Frank's Site`
2. Create a heading 1 tag inside the `body` that says "My First Multi-Page Website"
3. Then add a paragraph that has at least 4 sentences about something that you are interested in.
4. Add two more sections each with its own `heading` and either a `paragraph` or a `list` (ordered or unordered your choice). You do not need to write your own content, just paste some [*lorem ipsum*](https://lipsum.com) instead. You should now have a total of 3 sections.
5. Add 2 working anchor tags to your site. The hyperlinks can open in a new window using the attribute: `target="_blank"` or in the same window without that attribute. [Help with hyperlinks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0Wt5ECAyHM)
6. Find and upload 3 relevant images, that are all the same size, to the `img` folder. [Help with finding images](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTjb_UQa8G8) 
7. Add the html code so that those 3 images are displayed on your site. Each section should have 1 image. [Help with adding img tags](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxems65kg8Y)
8. If you have more time, replace the lorem ipsum filler text with some actual content.
9. Get signed off by your teacher for day 1.

## Day 2 
1. Expand your site again to include 2 sub pages. A home page `index.html`, this page is already mostly done. The only thing that you need to add is 3 links (anchor tags), preferably near the top of the page.

- One link to the home page `index.html`
- One link to the second page `page2Name.html`. Favorite sport, team, book, movie or game.
- One link to the third page `page3Name.html`. Favorite animal, pet or top 5-10 reasons you do not like pets/animals.

The second and third pages should include:

- Links to all three pages exactly the same as the home page (near the top of the page)
- At least one content section with:
    - A heading
    - A paragraph text (Lorem Ipsum is fine)
    - At least one image.
        - Must have alt text.

2. Style your web pages using a single separated stylesheet.

- Open `style.css` and add a CSS rule that will change the background color of the web page. Note: **You will not need to add `<style>` tags because everything in `style.css` is CSS rules.
- Next add the `<link href="css/style.css rel="stylesheet">` tag to the `head` of `index.html`. Then re-run the program and the background color should change on the home page.
- If you add the same `link` to page 2 and page 3, all of the backgorunds (and all styles) should match.
- Add at least 4 more style rules to `style.css`. You should use at least 2 different selectors.
- For more ideas on adding style rules visit the [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_syntax.asp) 
 or [Mozilla](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/) CSS Reference pages.
